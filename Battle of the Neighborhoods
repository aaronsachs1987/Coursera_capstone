Introduction/Business Problem

To be explicit, this presentation would be targeting the owners/franchisers of a taco shop called Torchy's Tacos, based in Austin, TX.
The franchise is looking to expand oveer the next 10 years, and they have yet to announce a location anywhere on the west coast. I 
believe that this is a missed opportunity by the company and it would serve them well to expand to the area.

One of my favorite restaurants in the state of Texas is called Torchy's Tacos. They are a locally grown and built restaurant, that
started from a food truck in Austin. Since then, they have expanded to over 75 locations in 7 states. As a current Seattle-ite, one 
thing I have been missing is a good, quick, spicy Tex-Mex taco that you just can't find in the state of Washington. Torchy's would
be a welcome addition to the city of Seattle, and with the varied cultures in this metropolitan area of 4 million people. There are
plenty of local options for fresh vegetables, fish, and meat to match the high standard that Torchy's requires of it's restaurants.

Some advantages Seattle can offer Torchy's is: Local farms, local beer and wine, multiple universities to supply both a strong
customer base and a strong employee base, a large expat population from the state of Texas that already knows and loves the Torchy's
brand, and limited competition to the particular type of dining experience Torchy's can offer. 

I have looked, and I can tell you that NO ONE in Seattle can match all the cornerstones of the Torchy's experience: Variety and flavor
profile of the tacos, salsa's and sauce variations, excellent and fast customer service, wonderfully decorated interiors, well designed
bar spaces, and of course queso.

For this presentation, I plan on showing that not only is Torchy's guaranteed success in the Seattle market, but we can easily pinpoint
comparable neighborhoods to the Austin area, where this wonderful restaurant grew and prospered.
